% This is the magnetization curve shown in Figure 
% P9-5.  The first column is the MMF in ampere turns,
% and the second column is the internal generated 
% voltage in volts at a speed of 900 r/min.  To use
% this file in MATLAB, type "load prob_9_14_mag.dat".  
% The data will be loaded into an N x 2 array named
% "prob_9_14_mag", with the first column containing MMF
% and the second column containing the Ea.
% MATLAB function "interp1" can be used to recover
% a value from this curve.
