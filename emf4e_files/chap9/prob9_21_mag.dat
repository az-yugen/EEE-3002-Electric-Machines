% This is the magnetization curve shown given in  
% Problem 9-21.  The first column is the field current in
% amps, and the second column is the internal 
% generated voltage in volts at a speed of 1800 r/min.
% To use this file in MATLAB, type "load prob9_21_mag.dat".  
% The data will be loaded into an N x 2 array named
% "prob9_21_mag", with the first column containing If and 
% the second column containing the open-circuit voltage.
% MATLAB function "interp1" can be used to recover
% a value from this curve.
