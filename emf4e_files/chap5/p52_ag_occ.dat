% This is the unsaturated open-circuit characteristic 
% shown in Figure P5-2a.  The first column is the field 
% current in amps, and the second column is the unsaturated
% open-circuit terminal voltage in volts.  To use
% this file in MATLAB, type "load p52_ag_occ.dat".  The
% data will be loaded into an N x 2 array named
% "p52_ag_occ", with the first column containing If and 
% the second column containing the open-circuit voltage.
% MATLAB function "interp1" can be used to recover
% a value from this curve.
