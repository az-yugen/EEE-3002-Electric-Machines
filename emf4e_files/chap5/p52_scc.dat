% This is the short-circuit characteristic shown
% in Figure P5-2b.  The first column is the field 
% current in amps, and the second column is the
% short-circuit terminal current in amps.  To use
% this file in MATLAB, type "load p52_scc.dat".  The
% data will be loaded into an N x 2 array named
% "p52_scc", with the first column containing If and 
% the second column containing the short-circut current.
% MATLAB function "interp1" can be used to recover
% a value from this curve.
